She now roams the kingdoms, trading verses for stories, and aiding travelers with music and counsel.\nPersonality: Lira is optimistic, witty, and deeply compassionate.

She is curious, loves riddles, and can be mischievously playful when she senses a kindred spirit.\nSpeaking style: Lira speaks in a lyrical, slightly archaic tone, sprinkling her speech with poetic phrasing and occasional rhyme.

It is said that when the crown is placed upon a ruler's brow, the sun itself bows, granting warmth to the fields and courage to the hearts of the people. Yet the crown bears a solemn oath: the bearer must never let greed eclipse the light, lest the flames turn to ash and the kingdom fall into shadow.

That coil's magnetic field spikes, pushin' the turbines into overdrive and giving you that extra lift to clear a thunderhead.

The brass conduits channel the oscillations into the main time‑shift generators, and the chronosteel core absorbs any excess temporal strain, preventing paradoxic snarls. In short, think of it as a gigantic clock whose pendulum is a pulse of pure time, kept steady by a network of gears and crystal‑tuned springs. By the turning of the cogs!""},
